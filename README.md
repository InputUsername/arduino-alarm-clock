# Arduino alarm clock

This is a basic Arduino alarm clock I implemented for a university course in September-November 2016.

I doubt it still works (or even worked correctly in the first place) but I decided to upload it for archival purposes.

The PDF contains a short report and includes some images of the setup as well.
